        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <!-- 
            name="viewport": This attribute specifies that the settings apply to the "viewport," 
                    which is the visible area of a web page on a device's screen. 
                    The viewport can vary in size depending on the device. EX: mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

            content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0": The content attribute contains two important settings:
                width=device-width: sets the width of the viewport to be equal to the device's screen width.
                initial-scale=1.0: This specifies the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded. 
                        - A value of 1.0 means no zoom, so the page will be displayed at its natural size.
